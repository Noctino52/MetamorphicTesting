# Morfify
> A Metamorphic Test solution for Web Application

# How to start
The application actually don't have any installer and for this must be imported in the own IDE for be executed.  
Frist you need to [create a new one repository Git](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-new-repository), do a copy of the original repository, to then effect the *mirror* of the local copy.  
From *Command line* of Git:  

```
$ git clone --bare https://github.com/Noctino52/Morfify
$ cd Morfify
$ git push --mirror https://github.com/Noctino52/Morfify
$ cd ..
$ rm -rf Morfify
```

# Brief description
Morfify is an eviroment of Metamorphic Testing for web application.  
It uses the Metamorphic Testing technique to potentially test all the functionality of any program, simply starting from a test case (Source test case) registered with Selenium IDE.  
With the use of a Metamorphic Relation, a property expressed in code of a function of the expected program, Morfify is able to create test cases with slight difference on the input, called Follow-up test cases and to verify if these tests are "similar" in terms of the contents of the pages visited during their execution.

To show the potential of the eviroment, there is an example of use with the PetClinic *sample* web application.
## [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
Is a testing framework and indicates a suite, composed of different tools: Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver, Selenium Builder, Selenium Server, Selenium Grid; in our case, we used the frist two.  
Provides a domain language (DSL), which is a specification language dedicated to problems in a specific domain or to a particular technical solution.

Allows you to write tests for the major programming languages, including Java, Python, Ruby, C# and PHP.
## [Petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) 
PetClinic is a _**web application**_ for management of a veterinary clinic, allows the addition/search of animal owners, as well as the addition of the latter and their visits to the clinic. 

Is composed by varius Spring framework like:
- Spring Server
- Spring Bootmk 
- Spring Authentication

The application allows you to choose to save the DBMS with in-memory technology (H2) or in the traditional way (MySql).
## Architettura del sistema 
Morfify is composed by five part:

![ComponentiMorfifyEN](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20641545/118630998-5f4e1c80-b7cf-11eb-865a-d84e3b967ca8.png)

1.**Source test case creation**:Is the component that takes in input the test case to be executed, it is a JSON parser (TestCaseCreator) which takes as input a file generated by Selenium IDE and transforms it into an object of the TestCase class; trivially it is the component that brings the input into the envirement.  
2.**Follow-Up test cases creations**: Is the component that takes care, starting from a copy of the source test case, to apply the changes imposed by the set of rules given in input.  The output of the system in question is always one or more TestCase objects defined as a Follow-Up.  
3.**Test case esecution**: With the API of Selenium WebDriver, both input and generated test cases are run.  
4.**Round-up of pages**: During the execution, a listner (DESIGN PATTERN Builder) is supported that keeps track of the page changes, both from a code point of view (HTML, CSS etc ...) and trivially visual (Create a screenshot for each page), the execution of a test case becomes an ordered list of pages that are visited and will be an integral part of the output.  
5.**Verify**: Through the information collected during the execution of Source and Follow-Up test cases, the pages visited by the source and those of the various Follow-ups are compared; the pages must be "near-similar" to each other otherwise a Source test case Faulty will have occurred.  

## Directory structure
The folder *src* contains the application of PetClinic (*main*) and the source code of Morfify (*test*).  
The folder *testFile* contains where they will be taken the file *.side* registered with Selenium IDE.  
The folder *documentazione* contains all the documentation around Morfify.  
The folder *Output* contain an ordered list of pages for all Source and Follow-Up test cases created and produced during execution.  
## Documentation
For further information, refer to chapter three, four and five of the [degree thesis](documentazione/Tesi.pdf) associated with this project.
